isovia.1.d:0 "President William Allard was killed by an armed group that took the presidential escort by surprise. The attack occurred during an official visit to a newly inaugurated factory in the Bastione industrial area. Never before had an attack of this kind occurred on the island of Isovia. Bastion ruined by the financial crisis of 1929, despite government subsidies, continues to be a very dangerous city with criminal organizations and political extremists. What is the future of Isovia?"
